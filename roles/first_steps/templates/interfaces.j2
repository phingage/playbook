# The address and gateway are necessary.
# The netmask is taken automatically from the block.
# Example: /24 is considered to be a public IP address: netmask 255.255.255.0

# This is a private IP address. Private IPs do not have a gateway (they are not publicly routable).
# All you need to specify is the address and the block. The netmask is taken from the block.
# Example: /17 is considered to be a private IP address: netmask 255.255.128.0
